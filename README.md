# page-fault-algorithms

Write a program that implements the FIFO, Optimal, MFU, and LRU page-replacement
algorithms. Given a page-reference string, where page numbers range from 0 to 9,
apply the page-reference string to each algorithm, and output the number of page faults
incurred by each algorithm. Write your code so that the number of page frames in the
page table can vary from 1 to 10.
